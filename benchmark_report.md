# Benchmark Report

## Results

### 1. Game Initialization
- **Time Taken**: 534.5083 seconds
- **Percentage of Total Time**: 72.84%

### 2. Image Generation
- **Time Taken**: 199.3173 seconds
- **Percentage of Total Time**: 27.16%

## Analysis

- **Game Initialization**: If the time exceeds 1 second, consider optimizing the scenario generation process.
- **Scenario Update**: A time below 0.5 seconds is ideal for smooth gameplay. If higher, check threading or logic efficiency.
- **Image Generation**: This is expected to take the longest. If it exceeds 5 seconds, consider optimizing image generation or reusing assets.

### Summary
- Game Initialization is slower than expected. Optimization recommended.
- Image Generation is taking too long. Optimization or asset reuse is advised.

## Total Time
- **Total Benchmark Time**: 733.8257 seconds
- **Longest Task**: Game Initialization
