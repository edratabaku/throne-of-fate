  abstract   = {There are large volume of data from the online news sources that are freely available which might contain valuable information. Data such as cyber-attacks news keep growing bigger and can be analyzed to gather informative insights of current situation. However, news is reported in many styles, added with the emerging of new cyber-attack and the ambiguous terms used have made the detection of the related news become more difficult. Thus, to handle these situations, the aim of this paper is to propose a scheme on detecting the related news about cyber-attacks. The scheme starts with identifying the cyber-attack features which will be used to classify the cyber-attack news. The scheme also includes a machine learning approach using Conditional Random Field (CRF) classifier and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) for further analysis. The results from this research should help people by showing the actual picture of cyber-attack occurrences in our surrounding and give valuable information to public thus raising social awareness about cyber-attack activities.},

The higher the accuracy is, the more robust the defense mechanism will be. In an ideal scenario (i.e., 100\% accuracy) the system can detect zero-day malware without being concerned about mistakenly tagging benign files as malware or enabling disruptive malicious code running as none-malicious ones. This paper investigates different machine learning algorithms to find out how well they can detect zero-day malware. Through the examination of 34 machine/deep learning classifiers, we found that the random forest classifier offered the best accuracy. The paper poses several research questions regarding the performance of machine and deep learning algorithms when detecting zero-day malware with zero rates for false positive and false negative.},

  abstract     = {An adaptive intrusion detection system that can detect unknown attacks in real-time network traffic is a major concern. Conventional adaptive intrusion detection systems are computationally expensive in terms of computer resources and time because these systems have to be retrained with known and unknown attacks. In this study, a method called Real-Time Multi-agent System for an Adaptive Intrusion Detection System RTMAS-AIDS, which is based on a multi-agent system, is proposed to allow the intrusion detection system to adapt to unknown attacks in real-time. This method utilizes the classification models multi-level hybrid SVM and ELM to detect normal behavior and known attacks. An adaptive SVM model, in which processes run in parallel and are distributed in MAS, is also used to detect and learn new attacks in real-time. Results show that the proposed method significantly reduced the training cost of detecting unknown attacks compared with the conventional method. In addition, the analysis results of the popular KDDCup’99 dataset show that RTMAS-AIDS can detect Probe, R2L, and U2R attacks better than the non-retrained multi-agent system using the multi-level hybrid SVM and ELM models as well as the multi-level hybrid SVM and ELM. RTMAS-AIDS exhibited a significantly improved detection accuracy that reached 95.86\% and can detect and learn unknown attacks faster (up to 61\%) than the other two methods (MAS-MLSE and MLSE).},

  abstract     = {One of the most relevant security problems is inferring whether a program has malicious intent (malware software). Even though Antivirus is one of the most popular approaches for malware detection, new types of malware are released at a fast pace, making most techniques for detecting them quickly obsolete. Thus, regular Antivirus typically fails to detect new malware until their signature is incorporated into their database. Nevertheless, new techniques to identify unknown malware are necessary to protect systems even at the day zero of a malware release. Few-shot learning is an approach that consists of using a few examples from each class while training a model. A compelling case of this approach is classifying objects classes that have not yet been used in the training set, namely Zero-shot Learning. In the present work, we propose Malware-SMELL, a new Zero-shot learning method to classify malware using visual representation. In Malware-SMELL, we propose a new representation space to calculate the similarity between pairs of objects, called S-Space. This new representation enhances the class separability and, thus, makes such a challenging classification process more efficient. Malware-SMELL reached 80\% of recall and outperforms other methods by a ratio of 9.58\% in a classification model trained only with goodware code on real-world datasets in Generalized Zero-shot Learning paradigm.},

Meanwhile, due to the popularity of Twitter, it also becomes a main target for spamming activities. In order to stop spammers, Twitter is using Google SafeBrowsing to detect and block spam links. Despite that blacklists can block malicious URLs embedded in tweets, their lagging time hinders the ability to protect users in real-time. Thus, researchers begin to apply different machine learning algorithms to detect Twitter spam. However, there is no comprehensive evaluation on each algorithms' performance for real-time Twitter spam detection due to the lack of large groundtruth. To carry out a thorough evaluation, we collected a large dataset of over 600 million public tweets. We further labelled around 6.5 million spam tweets and extracted 12 light weight features, which can be used for online detection. In addition, we have conducted a number of experiments on six machine learning algorithms under various conditions to better understand their effectiveness and weakness for timely Twitter spam detection. We will make our labelled dataset for researchers who are interested in validating or extending our work.},

  abstract     = {The popularity of Twitter attracts more and more spammers. Spammers send unwanted tweets to Twitter users to promote websites or services, which are harmful to normal users. In order to stop spammers, researchers have proposed a number of mechanisms. The focus of recent works is on the application of machine learning techniques into Twitter spam detection. However, tweets are retrieved in a streaming way, and Twitter provides the Streaming API for developers and researchers to access public tweets in real time. There lacks a performance evaluation of existing machine learning-based streaming spam detection methods. In this paper, we bridged the gap by carrying out a performance evaluation, which was from three different aspects of data, feature, and model. A big ground-truth of over 600 million public tweets was created by using a commercial URL-based security tool. For real-time spam detection, we further extracted 12 lightweight features for tweet representation. Spam detection was then transformed to a binary classification problem in the feature space and can be solved by conventional machine learning algorithms. We evaluated the impact of different factors to the spam detection performance, which included spam to nonspam ratio, feature discretization, training data size, data sampling, time-related data, and machine learning algorithms. The results show the streaming spam tweet detection is still a big challenge and a robust detection technique should take into account the three aspects of data, feature, and model.},

  abstract     = {The idea of “citizen sensing” and “human as sensors” is crucial for social Internet of Things, an integral part of cyber–physical–social systems (CPSSs). Social media data, which can be easily collected from the social world, has become a valuable resource for research in many different disciplines, e.g., crisis/disaster assessment, social event detection, or the recent COVID-19 analysis. Useful information, or knowledge derived from social data, could better serve the public if it could be processed and analyzed in more efficient and reliable ways. Advances in deep neural networks have significantly improved the performance of many social media analysis tasks. However, deep learning models typically require a large amount of labeled data for model training, while most CPSS data is not labeled, making it impractical to build effective learning models using traditional approaches. In addition, the current state-of-the-art, pretrained natural language processing (NLP) models do not make use of existing knowledge graphs, thus often leading to unsatisfactory performance in real-world applications. To address the issues, we propose a new zero-shot learning method which makes effective use of existing knowledge graphs for the classification of very large amounts of social text data. Experiments were performed on a large, real-world tweet data set related to COVID-19, the evaluation results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms six baseline models implemented with state-of-the-art deep learning models for NLP.},

Current machine learning models require large volumes of high-quality annotated data, which is a major obstacle given the inherent scarcity of such data in OTIFs. Bridging this research gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning strategy that capitalizes on both labeled and unlabeled data to automate threat identification. Our unique contribution is an advanced iteration of the GAN-BERT framework, which incorporates a self-supervised contrastive objective function to fine-tune the BERT language model. Our experiments show that this method outperforms the original BERT and GAN-BERT, achieving a 3-12\% F1-score improvement on various OTIFs datasets. Furthermore, we present an efficient method for selecting hard negatives during training, which further enhances our model’s performance. This innovative approach significantly advances the field of automated threat detection, reducing reliance on human supervision and effectively addressing the issue of limited annotated data. Thus, it offers a robust solution for strengthening security posture through proactive decision making in Cyber Threat Intelligence.},

These systems depend on the timeliness and relevance of the latest updates, patches and threats provided by cyberthreat intelligence feeds. Open source intelligence platforms, namely social media networks such as Twitter, are capable of aggregating a vast amount of cybersecurity-related sources. To process such information streams, we require scalable and efficient tools capable of identifying and summarizing relevant information for specified assets. This paper presents the processing pipeline of a novel tool that uses deep neural networks to process cybersecurity information received from Twitter. A convolutional neural network identifies tweets containing security-related information relevant to assets in an IT infrastructure. Then, a bidirectional long short-term memory network extracts named entities from these tweets to form a security alert or to fill an indicator of compromise.

However, current OSCTI gathering and management solutions mainly focus on structured Indicators of Compromise (IOC) feeds, which are lowlevel and isolated, providing only a narrow view of potential threats. Meanwhile, the extensive and interconnected knowledge found in the unstructured text of numerous OSCTI reports (e.g., security articles, threat reports) available publicly is still largely underexplored. To bridge the gap, we propose THREATKG, an automated system for OSCTI gathering and management. THREATKG efficiently collects a large number of OSCTI reports from multiple sources, leverages specialized AI-based techniques to extract high-quality knowledge about various threat entities and their relationships, and constructs and continuously updates a threat knowledge graph by integrating new OSCTI data. THREATKG features a modular and extensible design, allowing for the addition of components to accommodate diverse OSCTI report structures and knowledge types. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate THREATKG’s practical effectiveness in enhancing threat knowledge gathering and management.},

  abstract   = {The last few years have seen a radical shift in the cyber defense paradigm from reactive to proactive, and this change is marked by the steadily increasing trend of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) sharing. Currently, there are numerous Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) sources providing periodically updated threat feeds that are fed into various analytical solutions. At this point, there is an excessive amount of data being produced from such sources, both structured (STIX, OpenIOC, etc.) as well as unstructured (blacklists, etc.). However, more often than not, the level of detail required for making informed security decisions is missing from threat feeds, since most indicators are atomic in nature, like IPs and hashes, which are usually rather volatile. These feeds distinctly lack strategic threat information, like attack patterns and techniques that truly represent the behavior of an attacker or an exploit. Moreover, there is a lot of duplication in threat information and no single place where one could explore the entirety of a threat, hence requiring hundreds of man hours for sifting through numerous sources —trying to discern signal from noise — to find all the credible information on a threat. We have made use of natural language processing to extract threat feeds from unstructured cyber threat information sources with approximately 70\% precision, providing comprehensive threat reports in standards like STIX, which is a widely accepted industry standard that represents CTI. The automation of an otherwise tedious manual task would ensure the timely gathering and sharing of relevant CTI that would give organizations the edge to be able to proactively defend against known as well as unknown threats.},

We also co-design a training procedure to preserve end-to-end model accuracy post quantization. As a result, the proposed quantization scheme improves the tradeoff between accuracy and on-device latency. The improvements are significant even on MobileNets, a model family known for run-time efficiency, and are demonstrated in ImageNet classification and COCO detection on popular CPUs.},

It is challenging, especially in case of text within the limited number of characters. Effective spam detection requires more number of efficient features to be learned. In the current article, the use of a deep learning technology known as a convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed for spam detection with an added semantic layer on the top of it. The resultant model is known as a semantic convolutional neural network (SCNN). A semantic layer is composed of training the random word vectors with the help of Word2vec to get the semantically enriched word embedding. WordNet and ConceptNet are used to find the word similar to a given word, in case it is missing in the word2vec. The architecture is evaluated on two corpora: SMS Spam dataset (UCI repository) and Twitter dataset (Tweets scrapped from public live tweets). The authors' approach outperforms the-state-of-the-art results with 98.65\% accuracy on SMS spam dataset and 94.40\% accuracy on Twitter dataset.},

  abstract    = {Publicly available information contains valuable information for Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). This can be used to prevent attacks that have already taken place on other systems. Ideally, only the initial attack succeeds and all subsequent ones are detected and stopped. But while there are different standards to exchange this information, a lot of it is shared in articles or blog posts in non-standardized ways. Manually scanning through multiple online portals and news pages to discover new threats and extracting them is a time-consuming task. To automize parts of this scanning process, multiple papers propose extractors that use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from documents. However, while this already solves the problem of extracting the information out of documents, the search for these documents is rarely considered. In this paper, a new focused crawler is proposed called ThreatCrawl, which uses Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based models to classify documents and adapt its crawling path dynamically. While ThreatCrawl has difficulties to classify the specific type of Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) named in texts, e.g., IOC content, it can successfully find relevant documents and modify its path accordingly. It yields harvest rates of up to 52\%, which are, to the best of our knowledge, better than the current state of the art. The results and source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.},

We discuss five different versions of Naive Bayes, and compare them on six new, non-encoded datasets, that contain ham messages of particular Enron users and fresh spam messages. The new datasets, which we make publicly available, are more realistic than previous comparable benchmarks, because they maintain the temporal order of the messages in the two categories, and they emulate the varying proportion of spam and ham messages that users receive over time. We adopt an experimental procedure that emulates the incremental training of personalized spam filters, and we plot roc curves that allow us to compare the different versions of nb over the entire tradeoff between true positives and true negatives.},

  abstract   = {While neural networks have advanced the frontiers in many applications, they often come at a high computational cost. Reducing the power and latency of neural network inference is key if we want to integrate modern networks into edge devices with strict power and compute requirements. Neural network quantization is one of the most effective ways of achieving these savings but the additional noise it induces can lead to accuracy degradation. In this white paper, we introduce state-of-the-art algorithms for mitigating the impact of quantization noise on the network's performance while maintaining low-bit weights and activations. We start with a hardware motivated introduction to quantization and then consider two main classes of algorithms: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware-Training (QAT). PTQ requires no re-training or labelled data and is thus a lightweight push-button approach to quantization. In most cases, PTQ is sufficient for achieving 8-bit quantization with close to floating-point accuracy. QAT requires fine-tuning and access to labeled training data but enables lower bit quantization with competitive results. For both solutions, we provide tested pipelines based on existing literature and extensive experimentation that lead to state-of-the-art performance for common deep learning models and tasks.},

In fact, recent advances in technology are causing OSINT to currently evolve at a dizzying rate, providing innovative data-driven and AI-powered applications for politics, economy or society, but also offering new lines of action against cyberthreats and cybercrime. The paper at hand describes the current state of OSINT and makes a comprehensive review of the paradigm, focusing on the services and techniques enhancing the cybersecurity field. On the one hand, we analyze the strong points of this methodology and propose numerous ways to apply it to cybersecurity. On the other hand, we cover the limitations when adopting it. Considering there is a lot left to explore in this ample field, we also enumerate some open challenges to be addressed in the future. Additionally, we study the role of OSINT in the public sphere of governments, which constitute an ideal landscape to exploit open data.},

We then provide the language model with natural language descriptions of classification tasks as input and train it to generate the correct answer in natural language via a language modeling objective. This allows the model to generalize to new classification tasks without the need for multiple multitask classification heads. We show the zero-shot performance of these generative language models, trained with weak supervision, on six benchmark text classification datasets from the torchtext library. Despite no access to training data, we achieve up to a 45\% absolute improvement in classification accuracy over random or majority class baselines.

  abstract    = {Zero-shot Learners are models capable of predicting unseen classes. In this work, we propose a Zero-shot Learning approach for text categorization. Our method involves training model on a large corpus of sentences to learn the relationship between a sentence and embedding of sentence’s tags. Learning such relationship makes the model generalize to unseen sentences, tags, and even new datasets provided they can be put into same embedding space. The model learns to predict whether a given sentence is related to a tag or not; unlike other classifiers that learn to classify the sentence as one of the possible classes. We propose three different neural networks for the task and report their accuracy on the test set of the dataset used for training them as well as two other standard datasets for which no retraining was done. We show that our models generalize well across new unseen classes in both cases. Although the models do not achieve the accuracy level of the state of the art supervised models, yet it evidently is a step forward towards general intelligence in natural language processing.},

In this context, Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly significant in the field of cybersecurity. This study surveys the performance of ChatGPT, GPT4all, Dolly, Stanford Alpaca, Alpaca-LoRA, Falcon, and Vicuna LLM-based chatbots in binary classification and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks using Open-source intelligence (OSINT) to detect and extract structured data about cybersecurity threats. We utilize data collected in previous research from Twitter to assess the competitiveness of these chatbots when compared to specialized state-of-the-art models trained for those tasks. In binary classification experiments, the commercial chatbot GPT-4 achieved an acceptable F1 score of 0.94, and the open-source GPT4all achieved an F1 score of 0.90. However, when applied for cybersecurity entity recognition, all evaluated LLM-based chatbots have limitations and are less effective. This study demonstrates the capability of LLM-based chatbots for OSINT processing and shows that they require further improvement in NER to effectively replace specially trained models. Our results highlight their strengths and limitations compared to specialized models. This provides insights for researchers to enhance LLM-based chatbots to reduce the effort required to integrate machine learning in OSINT-based CTI tools.},

Conventional techniques are not capable of detecting zero-day attacks and sophisticated attacks. Thus far, heaps of machine learning techniques have been developed to detect the cybercrimes and battle against cyber threats.

  abstract    = {In today’s digital age, our dependence on IoT (Internet of Things) and IIoT (Industrial IoT) systems has grown immensely, which facilitates sensitive activities such as banking transactions and personal, enterprise data, and legal document exchanges. Cyberattackers consistently exploit weak security measures and tools. The Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) acts as a primary tool against such cyber threats. However, machine learningbased IDSs, when trained on specific attack patterns, often misclassify new emerging cyberattacks. Further, the limited availability of attack instances for training a supervised learner and the ever-evolving nature of cyber threats further complicate the matter. This emphasizes the need for an adaptable IDS framework capable of recognizing and learning from unfamiliar/unseen attacks over time. In this research, we propose a one-class classification-driven IDS system structured on two tiers. The first tier distinguishes between normal activities and attacks/threats, while the second tier determines if the detected attack is known or unknown. Within this second tier, we also embed a multi-classification mechanism coupled with a clustering algorithm. This model not only identifies unseen attacks but also uses them for retraining them by clustering unseen attacks. This enables our model to be futureproofed, capable of evolving with emerging threat patterns. Leveraging one-class classifiers (OCC) at the first level, our approach bypasses the need for attack samples, addressing data imbalance and zero-day attack concerns and OCC at the second level can effectively separate unknown attacks from the known attacks. Our methodology and evaluations indicate that the presented framework exhibits promising potential for real-world deployments.},

  abstract   = {Cybercrime has steadily increased over the last years, being nowadays the greatest security concern of most enterprises. Institutions often protect themselves from attacks by employing intrusion detection systems (IDS) that analyze the payload of packets to find matches with rules representing threats. However, the accuracy of these systems is as good as the knowledge they have about the threats. Nowadays, with the continuous flow of novel forms of sophisticated attacks and their variants, it is a challenge to keep an IDS updated. Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) could be explored to effectively obtain this knowledge, by retrieving information from diverse sources. This paper proposes a fully automated approach to update the IDS knowledge, covering the full cycle from OSINT data feed collection until the installation of new rules and blacklists. The approach was implemented as the IDSoSint system and was assessed with 49 OSINT feeds and production traffic. It was able to identify in real time various forms of malicious activities, including botnet C\&C servers communications, remote access applications, brute-force attacks, and phishing events.},

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of zero-shot learning. First of all, we provide an overview of zero-shot learning. According to the data utilized in model optimization, we classify zero-shot learning into three learning settings. Second, we describe different semantic spaces adopted in existing zero-shot learning works. Third, we categorize existing zero-shot learning methods and introduce representative methods under each category. Fourth, we discuss different applications of zero-shot learning.

However this is particularly difficult when historical audit data is scarce. Zero-shot learning can address this limitation by compensating the absence of examples with semantic knowledge, allowing to better estimate behavior of unknown users. In this paper, we address insider threat detection in two use cases where historical user data is unavailable or obsolete. We extend an existing intrusion detection system by adding information describing user positions, roles and projects assignments. These semantic descriptions are encoded via graph embeddings. Experimental results show that providing this additional context improves insider threat detection significantly. This suggests that zero-shot learning is a promising way of improving intrusion detection systems.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, due to the frequent occurrence of network intrusions, more and more researchers have begun to focus on network intrusion detection. However, it is still a challenge to detect unknown attacks. Currently, there are two main methods of unknown attack detection: clustering and honeypot. But they still have unsolved problems such as difficulty in collecting unknown attack samples and failure to detect on time. Zero-Shot learning is proposed to deal with the problem in this article, which can recognize unknown attacks by learning the mapping relations between feature space and semantic space (such as attribute space). When the semantic descriptions of all attacks (including known and unknown attacks) are provided, the classifier built by Zero-Shot learning can extract common semantic information among all attacks and construct connections between known and unknown attacks. The classifier then utilizes the connections to classify unknown attacks although there are no samples for unknown attacks. In this article, we first propose to use Zero-Shot learning to overcome the challenge of unknown attack detection and illustrate the feasibility of this method. Secondly, we then propose a novel method of Zero-Shot learning based on sparse autoencoder for unknown attack detection. This method maps the feature of known attacks to the semantic space, and restores the semantic space to the feature space by constrains of reconstruction error, and establishes the feature to semantic mapping, which is used to detect unknown attacks. Verification tests have been carried out by using the public dataset NSL\_KDD. From the experiments conducted in this work, the results show that the average accuracy reaches 88.3\%, which performs better than other methods.},

  abstract     = {In the last decade, researchers, practitioners and companies struggled for devising mechanisms to detect cyber-security threats. Among others, those efforts originated rule-based, signature-based or supervised Machine Learning (ML) algorithms that were proven effective for detecting those intrusions that have already been encountered and characterized. Instead, new unknown threats, often referred to as zero-day attacks or zero-days, likely go undetected as they are often misclassified by those techniques. In recent years, unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms showed potential to detect zero-days. However, dedicated support for quantitative analyses of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms is still scarce and often does not promote meta-learning, which has potential to improve classification performance. To such extent, this paper introduces the problem of zero-days and reviews unsupervised algorithms for their detection. Then, the paper applies a question-answer approach to identify typical issues in conducting quantitative analyses for zero-days detection, and shows how to setup and exercise unsupervised algorithms with appropriate tooling. Using a very recent attack dataset, we debate on i) the impact of features on the detection performance of unsupervised algorithms, ii) the relevant metrics to evaluate intrusion detectors, iii) means to compare multiple unsupervised algorithms, iv) the application of meta-learning to reduce misclassifications. Ultimately, v) we measure detection performance of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms with respect to zero-days. Overall, the paper exemplifies how to practically orchestrate and apply an appropriate methodology, process and tool, providing even non-experts with means to select appropriate strategies to deal with zero-days.},
