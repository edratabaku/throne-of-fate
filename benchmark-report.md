- **Memory**: 16 GB
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 10.0.26100
- **Framework/Language**: .NET 6.0.NET 6.0.NET 6.0[Insert framework/language details]

## Benchmarked Components
1. [Component 1: e.g., Game Engine Initialization]
2. [Component 2: e.g., AI Decision Making]
3. [Component 3: e.g., Rendering Performance]

## Benchmark Setup
To set up and run benchmarks for the **Throne of Fate** project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Benchmarking Tools**:
   - For Python: Use `pytest-benchmark` (`pip install pytest-benchmark`).
   - For .NET: Use `BenchmarkDotNet` (add the NuGet package).
   - For JavaScript/Node.js: Use `benchmark` or `performance` APIs.

2. **Write Benchmark Tests**:
   - Identify the functions or components to benchmark.
   - Create test cases that measure execution time and memory usage.

3. **Run Benchmarks**:
   - Execute the benchmark tests using the appropriate command or script.
   - Example for Python: `pytest --benchmark-only`.
   - Example for .NET: Run the `BenchmarkRunner` in your test project.

4. **Collect Results**:
   - Save the output of the benchmark tests.
   - Analyze the results to identify bottlenecks.
